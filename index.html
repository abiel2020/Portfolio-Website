                <p>Conquer the Campus is a school-wide game of capture the flag that is hosted by Theta Chi and the ASA sorority. The event is held annually and took place for the first time this fall semester. Conquer the Campus was the idea of our previous
                    events coordinator Jamison Friauf (image left) who wanted to create a charity event that would bring the greater RIT community together. The cost to sign up for this event was five dollars which would be donated to the Center for Youth.
                    Conquer the Campus has two teams, Greeks and Romans and participants would get to choose what team they played for.</p>

                <p>This was a team project that was assigned in my class, Task Automation and Interpretive Languages. We wrote an APM tool in Bash that will monitor a mix of processes in the form of executable programs written in C. The script will start
                    the processes, collect performance metrics, and perform a clean-up at the end to kill these processes.

                <p>The purpose of this project is to create a Packet Capture Analysis (PCA) tool that computes metrics from these packet captures that could be used in decision making. Packet capture analysis allows network engineers, system administrators,
                    and security analysts to quantify network performance and analyze network traffic using packet captures on various components in the network. Packet capture analysis may result in outcomes such as introducing additional network components
                    for load balancing, new routes/paths through the network, or spinning up further analysis for confirming networking breaches.
